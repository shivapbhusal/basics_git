\section{Introduction}
\textit{Git} is a distributed version control system which can serve as a better alternative to centralized version control systems like \textit{TFS} and \textit{SVN}. There are many advantages of \textit{Git} over the centralized version control systems which can be summarized in the following points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is distributed. So, each developer has a full copy of the repository.
    \item It handles complex merges faster.
    \item For collaborative development involving thousands of developers, \textit{Git} is suited better suited than centralized version control systems.
    \item Branching is cheap and switching between branches is easy.
    \item In general, it provides more functionality and control than the centralized version control systems.
\end{itemize}

Besides, most of the open source projects use \textit{Git} as the version control system. So, if you are interested in open source projects, you are expected to know the basics of \textit{Git}. In this tutorial, you will learn how to install and setup \textit{Git} and use it as a version control system for your projects. 

\section{Installation and Setup}
    Follow the instructions in the link below to download and install \textit{Git}.\\

%\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
\url{https://git-scm.com/downloads}
%\end{lstlisting}
\\

After you install \textit{Git}, create an account on \href{https://github.com/}{\textit{Github}} or \href{https://about.gitlab.com/}{\textit{Gitlab}}.
Then, set up your identity using the commands below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git config --global user.email "jane.doe@gmail.com"
\end{lstlisting}

This will make sure that every time you make an update and push it, you are listed as the author of that update.\\

Now, create a repository in \textit{Github} or \textit{Gitlab}, and to get started, refer to the basic commands in section 3.

\section{Basic Git Commands}
\subsection{git clone}
It creates the local copy of the repository. In the example below, we are creating a local copy of the repository \textit{git-demo}.

 \begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.56]{figure/clone.png}}
    \caption{Cloning repository \textit{git-demo}}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{git status}
Gives the current status of the files in the local repository. The example below shows that there is an un-tracked file called \textit{foo.py} which has been created recently.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figure/status.png}}
    \caption{\textit{git status} after creating one file called \textit{foo.py}}
  \end{figure}


\subsection{git add}
Adds the changes for staging. In other words, this command decides which changes in the current version of the repository will go into the next version.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git add foo.py
\end{lstlisting}

In the example above, the file \textit{foo.py} has been added to the staging.

\subsection{git commit}
Confirms the changes in the local repository. Creates a new version of the repository incorporating the local changes.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git commit -m "add foo.py"
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{figure/commit.png}}
    \caption{\textit{git commit} operation}
  \end{figure}


\subsection{git push}
Merges the locally committed changes with the repository in the remote server.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git push
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{git pull}
Let's assume, another member of the team has already pushed the changes. In such a case, we do git pull to get the latest changes in the repository. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git pull
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{git branch}
Creates a new branch. In this example, a new branch of test\_branch is created. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git branch dev
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{git checkout}
Switches from the current branch to the specified branch.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git checkout dev
\end{lstlisting}

Now, we are switched from the master branch to the dev branch.


\subsection{git stash}
Ignores ( undoes) the uncommitted changes made in the local.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git stash
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figure/stash.png}}
    \caption{Git stash operation}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{git merge}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git merge origin/dev
\end{lstlisting}
Merges the changes of the specified branch with the current branch. In this example, the changes committed in the test\_branch are merged with the master branch. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \frame{\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{figure/merge.png}}
    \caption{Git merge operation}
  \end{figure}

\subsection{git log}
Displays the version history of the repository or the list of the historical commits. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
git log
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Using .gitignore}
It is not a good practice binary files and executable. You may also want to exclude some directories of your project from the staging. In order to exclude the selective files, a \textit{.gitignore} file can be used.

This will make sure that any file with extension \textit{.log} is ignored while performing the \textit{Git} operations.
